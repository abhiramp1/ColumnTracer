This repository consists of a Jupyter notebook that contains Python code to calculate values from an analytical solution to the one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation. The model describes the transport of a non-reactive tracer through a column.

A read-only version of the notebook can be viewed here:

A video describing the tool is available here:
